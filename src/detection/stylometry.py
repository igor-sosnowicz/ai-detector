# # Stylometry looks at a variety of features of an author's style such as:

# #     Word length
# #     Sentence length
# #     Paragraph length
# #     Punctuation
# #     Function words (for example: the, and, a, of, to, in, that, with, but, it)
# #     Letters
# #     N-grams, bigrams, trigrams (characters in a row)
# #     Bi-words and Tri-words (two or three words occurring in a certain order)
